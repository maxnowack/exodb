# Replication

Data replication is a planned feature and not implemented yet. At the moment, data replication can be achieved by using a persistence adapter like RxDB or Firebase and using their replication functionality.

* [RxDB Persistence Adapter](/data-persistence/rxdb/)
* [Firebase Persistence Adapter](/data-persistence/firebase/)
