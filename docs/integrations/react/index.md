# SignalDB React Integration

SignalDB can be integrated with React using the `@signaldb/react` package. This package provides the necessary bindings to use SignalDB with React components.
Also check out our guide on [how to use SignalDB with React](/guides/react/).

## Installation

You can install the `@signaldb/react` package using npm. Open your terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
  npm install @signaldb/react
```

## Exports

The `@signaldb/react` package exports the following components and hooks:

### `createUseReactivityHook`

This function creates a custom hook that provides reactivity to your components. It takes a function as the single argument that specifies the effect function of a reactive library.
The effect function must have the following signature:

```ts
(reactiveFunction: () => void) => () => void
```

The provided function is called with a reactive function that should be executed when the reactivity changes. The returned function is the cleanup function that removes the effect.
