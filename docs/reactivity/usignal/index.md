# Reactivity adapter for [`usignal`](https://github.com/WebReflection/usignal)

## Adapter

* 🚧 Experimental
* ❌ Automatic Cleanup 
* ❌ Scope check

The API of usignal doesn't allow [automatic cleanup nor reactive scope checking](/reactivity/#reactivity-libraries). Adapters without automatic cleanup are considered as **experimental**, as a manual cleanup isn't really convenient and a not properly cleanup can lead to memory leaks.

```bash
  $ npm install signaldb-adapter-usignal
```

## Usage

```js
import { Collection } from 'signaldb'
import reactivityAdapter from 'signaldb-adapter-usignal'
import { effect } from 'usignal'

const posts = new Collection({
  reactivity: reactivityAdapter,
})

effect(() => {
  const cursor = posts.find({ author: 'John' })
  console.log(cursor.count())
  return () => {
    // usignal doesn't allow to do automatic cleanup, so we have to do it ourself
    cursor.cleanup()
  }
})
```
