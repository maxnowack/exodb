# Reactivity adapter for [`@reactively/core`](https://github.com/modderme123/reactively)

## Adapter

* ✅ Automatic Cleanup 
* ❌ Scope check

The API of Reactively doesn't allow [reactive scope checking](/reactivity/#reactivity-libraries).
You must manually disable reactivity when making calls outside a reactive scope to avoid memory leaks. You can do this by passing `reactive: false` to your options (e.g. `<collection>.find({ ... }, { reactive: false })`).

```bash
  $ npm install signaldb-adapter-reactively
```

## Usage

```js
import { reactive } from '@reactively/core'
import { Collection } from 'signaldb'
import reactivityAdapter from 'signaldb-adapter-reactively'

const posts = new Collection({
  reactivity: reactivityAdapter,
})

reactive(() => {
  console.log(posts.find({ author: 'John' }).count())
})
```
