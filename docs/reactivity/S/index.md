# Reactivity adapter for [`S.js`](https://github.com/adamhaile/S)

## Adapter

* ✅ Automatic Cleanup
* ❌ Scope check

The API of S.js doesn't allow [reactive scope checking](/reactivity/#reactivity-libraries).
You must manually disable reactivity when making calls outside a reactive scope to avoid memory leaks. You can do this by passing `{ reactive: false }` to your options (e.g. `<collection>.find({ ... }, { reactive: false })`).

## Installation

```bash
  $ npm install @signaldb/sjs
```

## Usage

```js
import { Collection } from '@signaldb/core'
import reactivityAdapter from '@signaldb/sjs'
import S from 's-js'

const posts = new Collection({
  reactivity: reactivityAdapter,
})

S(() => {
  console.log(posts.find({ author: 'John' }).count())
})
```
